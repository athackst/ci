# Contributing

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/athackst/buildsmith/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/athackst/buildsmith/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
